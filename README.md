# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

### Overview

The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). It is widely used as a benchmark dataset for image classification and deep learning models.

This project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify the handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset with high accuracy.
### Outcomes

•	Achieved a high classification accuracy of 98%, demonstrating strong capability in image recognition tasks.

•	Showcased the practical application of neural networks in optical character recognition (OCR) and automated data entry solutions.
